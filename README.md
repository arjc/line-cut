## About 
Line cut is a silly litte candy crush knockoff that I made inspired by a discontinued game called flappy creator...
Like flappy creator I wanted users to create new skin/version of the game where you can add your own assets and share it with your friends. It's a silly little idea that I had, and I could work on my web dev skills and game making skills.

## How I made line cut
Line-cut is made purely using javascript.
I used [codewithfaraz's candy crush clone](https://www.codewithfaraz.com/content/294/creating-a-candy-crush-clone-html-css-and-javascript-tutorial-source-code) made using js, css and html. 
I editted the assets and made some changes, introduced new game mechanics like:
- Match 5 lines
- pop animation
- play sound on pop
- time limit
- score with motivation (lol)
- score saving feature

With this code as my foundation I started working on design and layout. With a homepage and a way to introduce new skins to the project
Overall, I learnt quite a lot of things and learn by starting this project, and enjoy every single part of making it what it is...

## Skins
- malayalam 
- malayalm 2
- breaking bad
- malayalam pop
- gen alpha brainrot 
- goofy animals
- Holiday special (limited time)

## Add your skin
I plan on adding more skins. If you have any socially relevant skins you can publish the assets to: my [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSciDnYp1TGabS4l23OnY19FEFb97OHeiSDXeh-UZ4NOf98mBg/viewform). If it's good then I'll add it to line-cut homepage with your name displayed.
